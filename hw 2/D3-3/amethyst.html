	<h1>Amethyst</h1>
	<p>Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz often used in jewelry.

	The name comes from the Koine Greek ἀμέθυστος amethystos from ἀ- a-, "not" and μεθύσκω methysko / μεθύω methyo, "intoxicate", a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness.[1] The ancient Greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication.

	It is one of several forms of quartz. Amethyst is a semiprecious stone and is the traditional birthstone for February.</p>
